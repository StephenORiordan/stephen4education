              <p>
                  <b>Lecture Recording Policy:</b> This past year has shown just how beneficial lecture recordings can be and why it’s essential that some form of them remain. They provide a safety net so students don’t fall behind and ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to learn. It’s key that this vital resource for students remains in place and that’s something I plan on fighting for. <br /> <br />
                  The current lecture recording policy is being reviewed and will likely be in place for crossover. It will be up to the new Education Officer to deal with this. If elected I plan on working with the UCC Vice-President for Teaching & Learning to represent the student voice in the implementation of this new policy. <br /> <br />
                  In the past training and technological barriers have been given as the reason for lack of further integration with lecture recording. Now, due to online learning, all staff have been equipped with the tools and know-how necessary to record their lectures so there’s little excuse not to see a further uptake in lecture recordings. The only barrier remaining is surrounding the intellectual property of staff and I hope to engage with the teaching unions (TUI, IFUT etc.) to address their concerns for the benefit of both students and staff. <br /> <br />
                  Simply put, recorded lectures benefit all students and limiting/reducing who can access them leaves so many behind.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>Continual Assessment (CA):</b> A variety of assessment methods is always better to gauge a student’s performance than a singular exam at the end of term. It’s been great to see that semester 1 for first years is now entirely CA. I’d like to see that expanded to the entirety of first year. It is of course necessary to point out that different people prefer different types of assessment. CA doesn’t inherently mean problem sets every week but can include in-class tests, group assignments, presentations etc. What is important is that we move away from 90 minute exams at the end of the year worth 80%. That is what I pledge to advocate for if elected.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>Departmental Communication:</b> It’s common for students to deal with multiple departments throughout their degree and experience a complete lack of communication between them for assignment deadlines and mid-term tests. IT allowing, I’d like to see a central reporting system so staff can be aware of what weeks are common hotspots for assignments to balance the workload throughout the semester. It’s unacceptable that a student could have 5 assignments due at any given time of the semester. <br /><br />
                  Assignment deadlines overlapping creates needless work for everyone to try to rectify and I’ve found students are often too busy getting an assignment done to reach out to ask for a deadline to be moved. Canvas automatically adds assignments to the timetable so if that was made public then any lecturer could check which assignments are due when and it would simplify the process for everyone.
