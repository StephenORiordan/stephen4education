                  <b>Disability Supports (DSS):</b> The work of the Disability Support Service (DSS) is fantastic and I’ve had the opportunity to see it first hand from my involvement with the Disability Activism & Awareness Society. The process of accessing these supports though can be difficult and tiresome. Individually emailing lectures for recordings or notes is laborious. Requiring a scribe to sit in a lecture is expensive and so it can be difficult to get one even if you need that resource. As an SU we should be advocating to simplify the processes of applying for these supports and make the DSS’s job as easy as possible. If elected I’d push for an opt-out system to be implemented for staff instead of the current opt-in. <br /> <br />
                  I would like to see these supports be available more generally though. Not every student that has a disability is registered with the DSS but they should be equally able to access them. Getting a formal diagnosis of a disability is expensive and cost prohibitive for many and we shouldn’t be shutting these students out of needed support. This is additionally compounded by the large underdiagnosis of learning disabilities in females, creating a gender gap in who is given access to extra support.

                  <b>Sanctuary Scholarships:</b> In the past few years we’ve seen harrowing stories of refugees in UCC and other universities facing deportation. It’s unacceptable that a young person seeking to educate themselves would face such a thing. We have a long history of being accepted abroad and we should extend that same courtesy to those who wish to come here. I’d fight against any deportation order for students and their families.<br /> <br />
                  Additionally, it’s a welcome move to see international fees waived for asylum seekers in the past year but the limitation requiring 3 years continuous education in Ireland before being able to apply for financial support restricts access to a lot of teenagers/young adults who want to study here. Anyone coming from abroad who wishes to study here should have the opportunity without cost restricting them.<br /> <br/>
                  If elected I'd advocate for a reduction in the restrictions refugees face in accessing student supports and an expansion of the sanctuary scholarship program so that more refugees and asylum seekers can access third level education.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>Placement:</b> One issue with placements is that students are unable to accept offers of employment after them due to still have a year of their degree to finish. I'd push for placement programmes to be able to be done in either 3rd or 4th year. This flexibility will allow students to take up employment after their placement or have the prior experience before applying to graduate programmes. Giving students the choice in their own education is the best path forward.<br /> <br />
                  Additionally, for the courses that don't have placement, it can be very hard for individual students to locate suitable work placements. I'd like to see more departments work to have summer internships available either through researchers in the department or by building relationships with local companies. These relationships could be used in future to set up a formal placement programme. Of course, it's paramount that these internships be at least subsidised as unpaid labour is just supervised exploitation. <br /> <br />
                  In the same vein, it’s important to address the issue of the Professional Master of Education students not being paid for their work even though they are primarily based in a school for the duration of their studies. The strong lobbying over the past few years meant that pharmacy students were entitled to paid placement so I pledge to fight in a similar way to ensure that PME students have the same right.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>Library/Skills Centre/UCC Units:</b> One of the key jobs of the Education Officer is maintaining a positive working relationship with all the different units within UCC. I plan on working with the library around seat hogging policy near exams to ensure everyone has access to the library space, working with the Skills Centre on courses useful to students such as digital literacy or academic referencing, and working with any other student facing services in UCC as the need arises. <br /> <br />
                  It’s also important that the services on satellite campuses match the needs of students. For example, I’d push for an expansion of the Brookfield library hours to ensure students on western campus can also study as fits their schedule best.
