              <h2>Representation</h2>
              <p>
                  <b>Electing Class Reps (UG & PG):</b> I firmly believe Class Reps are the backbone of the Union. They’re the quickest way to get feedback from students, they a great way to get student cohorts to self-unionise to fight for something within their department, they do a lot of advocacy work for their peers. It’s important that every class group in the university has a rep to make sure they feel included in our Union. I was responsible for electing Class Reps when I was SEFS College Rep and did my best to ensure there was a collegiate bond between those reps and the Union. Elections through Canvas have significantly streamlined the process but I want to make sure every rep feels included. <br /> <br />
                  Additionally, it’s important to address postgraduate student representation through the class rep system, particularly for research masters and PhD students. As they don’t have the typical class structure they’ve historically been neglected. I want to make sure every student has and knows who their reps are. For PG students one option is to have 2/3 reps for the entire PG group in the department but I want to make sure every option is explored so that they have the best representation possible.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>Student Council:</b> The Education Officer sits on the Student Council Steering Committee and is the main point of contact of the SU with the Council. As I’ve been the Council Chair for the last 2 years this is something that I’m very familiar with having worked closely with the last two Education Officers on this group. As a Union we are reportable to students through our updates at Council meetings (among other ways). Having the experience of the last two years I plan on building the relationship between Council and the Executive.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>PhD Worker Rights:</b> PhD students are currently left in a precarious position where most stipends provided by the Irish Research Council (IRC) or Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) don’t cover living costs. In fact, they often work out under minimum wage. Students who are dedicating a portion of their life to progressing human knowledge shouldn’t be left out in the dark like this. I’d hope to work with the Postgrad Representative to create a Postgrad Workers Right Group at UCC and link up with similar groups across the country to fight for adequate pay.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>Open Door/Inbox Policy:</b> Casework with students is a large part of the job and I’ve always advertised an open door/inbox policy in any role I’ve been in. I’d hope students would feel comfortable reaching out to ask for help as I’m always happiest when dealing with queries from students. No matter the question, I’m always glad to help out and that’s why I got into student representation in the first place.
