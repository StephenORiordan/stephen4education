                  Hi, I’m Stephen, a final year Physics & Applied Maths student. 
                  I’ve been engaged with student representation since I started University. 
                  I was a Class Rep in 1st year and have since served 3 terms on the SU Executive. 
                  I was first elected as the Science Engineering & Food Science (SEFS) College Rep in 2nd year 
                  and have been the Student Council Chairperson for the last 2 years. 
                  These positions have given me a wealth of experience in how the Union functions 
                  and I’ve had the honour of advocating for students by virtue of these positions. 
                  Both the College Reps and the Council Chair work closely with the Education Officer 
                  so I feel uniquely equipped to take on this role. 
                  As a College Rep I was responsible for electing 100+ Class Reps and representing over 4,000 students on the SU Executive. 
                  As Council Chair I presided over policy debate about the direction of our Union 
                  and have listened to student’s concerns throughout that time.
              </p>
              <p>
                  In my time as an Executive member I drafted and implemented a strategic plan for our Student Council,
                  I’m currently on the working group for the SU strategic plan and
                  I was part of the team that wrote our current constitution.
                  I have a large amount of policy experience that I think will benefit me in discussions with the University.
                  The greatest joy in these roles though was always in helping a student who came to me with an issue.
                  Improving the lives of students individually, or collectively was why I went into student representation.
                  Being able to help a single student’s concern made that day and
                  I would be honoured to continue to do that as your Education Officer
              </p>
              <p>
                  I’ve also been extensively involved with societies. 
                  I’ve held over a dozen positions on society committees and 
                  this last year I sat on the Societies Executive as the Trainings & Accessibility Officer. 
                  Accessibility, particularly accessibility in education, is a strong goal of mine and something 
                  I’ve worked with as part of the Disability Activism & Awareness (DAA) society. 
                  A large part of the Education Officer’s role is in training and supporting class reps 
                  which I am familiar with, having helped with the last 3 years of Class Rep Training.
              </p>
              <p>
                  For the last 9 months I’ve also worked as a student intern on a national Irish University Association (IUA)
                  project on digital education. This has involved working with UCC’s Digital Education Officer
                  and the Centre for Digital Education closely. In this role I’ve helped provide training for staff, 
                  done infographics on engaging with digital tools, hosted podcasts on teaching & learning through the pandemic 
                  and have been a student voice in numerous academic committees to ensure that the realities of learning online are raised.
              </p>
              <p>
                  Simply put I understand the role from my experience as Class Rep, SEFS Rep and Council Chair. 
                  I understand the necessity of advocacy work from my roles in DAA and the IUA. 
                  I love being able to help others and I would be truly honoured if you voted me as your next UCCSU Education Officer.
              </p>
