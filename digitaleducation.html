              <h2>Digital Education</h2>
              <p>
                  <b>Utilising Canvas:</b> Even through online learning there was still a quite varied uptake in the use of Canvas among staff. Some put all their content, question board, timetables etc. on it and others just dump a pdf file in the home tab and call it a day. It’s important that all the resources for a module are kept in one place. It’s significantly easier for a student when they know all the information will be available on the Canvas module and not scattered through email, websites or whatever other platform the lecturer is using. That consistency is something students value and something I have been fighting for this year with my work in the Centre for Digital Education. It’s something I plan on continuing if elected Education Officer. <br /> <br />
                  Analytics have become a large question surrounding Canvas use and I participated in a focus group to gauge student opinion on data collection. The ability to track how long a student is logged in for or whether they switch tabs or if they’ve watched a recording could be useful to help those that are struggling but I definitely worry about misuses of that data. It’s something that has already come up and will likely be an issue in the future. As Education Officer I’ll advocate for student choice on the matter. If an individual student wants to allow that collection of data so they can track their own progress then that’s their choice but I would advocate against a blanket implementation.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>Staff Training on Digital Tools:</b> COVID has opened our eyes to the possibilities of digital education but right now there is a fatigue with new technologies. I think it’s important to train staff on how to use these tools to remove some of the fear that exists with taking up a new piece of software. When lecturers are more comfortable or capable with a digital tool the learning experience is enhanced for students.
              </p>

              <p>
                  <b>Connecting & Supporting Students:</b> UCC launched the Digital Education Master Plan last year and one key goal in it is enabling student success. It’s important to recognise that a lot of social interaction has been missing with online learning. This relates to education through peer-to-peer learning. I certainly wouldn’t have done half as well in my degree if I didn’t have such a positive relationship with my classmates who I could ask for help. By connecting students together you better enable them to achieve what they want. As a Union one of our primary goals is connecting students. <br /> <br />
                  It’s also important that the digital education services that have existed through COVID remain and aren’t rolled back. I believe students want an on-campus experience but the supports of an online education. This is something that showed up in the UCCSU Student Feedback Form and a large priority of mine.
